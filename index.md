# About this blog

This blog is about building stuff for the joy of it, creating out of passion and growing my skillset for my own enjoyment and fulfillment without the expectation of popularity or success, just slow, steady and shared work, hence, the name of the blog: <b>quiet-wins</b>.

> <i>Perfect is the enemy of good</i>

That said, check the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> section for finished builds—write-ups detailing the steps I took to ship them.

For live updates, follow a project's progress on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/{{ site.author.bluesky }}">Bluesky</a>.

Thanks for reading—hope you enjoy! :)
